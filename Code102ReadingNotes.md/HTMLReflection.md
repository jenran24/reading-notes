*HTML Reflection*

HTML stands for "Hyper Text Markup Language," which is code that is used to structure a webpage. Anyting on a webpage, from the text to the formatting, is made with HTML.

An HTML element includes three parts: opening tag, content, and closing tag. Each piece instructs the text on what it looks like, it's formatting and where the element begins and ends. When an element is given extra information, it is called an attribute. A semantic element gives the text meaning, such as being a heading or being bold instead of normal text.
