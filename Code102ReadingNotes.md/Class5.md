# What is CSS?

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS allows us to make our web pages look pretty and stylized. This includes changing font size, color, and style.

There are three ways to use CSS in a style sheet:

1. External CSS: using the <link> element when typing code, I could stylize a webpage by adding elements (or additional coding) in the header of the page.
2. Internal CSS: I can use the < style > element in the head section as well.
3. Inline CSS: I could use the style attribute when I am typin the code to apply to a specific line.

For example, I could change the color of text in this page by adding text-color elements (I added spaces in the text example to not automcatically format it):

< p style =" color : red;"> Look below to see an example.</p>>

<p style="color:red;">Here is an example.</p>
