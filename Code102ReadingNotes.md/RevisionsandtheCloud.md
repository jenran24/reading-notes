*Notes on This Exercise*

Quite honestly, I learned a lot and I hated it. I felt like I was just getting the hang of GitHub and feeling confident and this exercise was so confusing. I don't understand why ewe have the back and forth between programs. However, I am learning more about different shortcuts and how to create files. That part is interesting.
