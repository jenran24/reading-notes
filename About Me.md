**About Me** 

Hi! My name is Jenna (she/her/hers), and I'm from Oregon. I have been an elementary teacher for the last five years and am switching to reading specialist next year. I did coding for my robotics team in high school for FTC Robotics, and took one term of Computer Science classes at OSU. After an awful experience at school and a great expereince volunteering for a LEGO robotics program at an elementary school, I switched paths to be a teacher! I love learning all things technology, extending my learning, and practicing different skills. When I'm off the computer, I love to read, doing photography, going on walks/hikes with my dog and my husband, and playing video games.
