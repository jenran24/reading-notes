My reading journal for CodeFellows - woohoo!

## About Me

# Growth Mindset

_Having a positive outlook on tasks or things that you are not confident about, and knowing that you can continue to learn and grow to get to where you want to be._

## Growth Mindset Reminders

1. I can become better the more I practice and learn.

2. I am not there yet.

3. I can ask others for advice who have been doing something longer than me.
