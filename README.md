# Reading Notes

My reading journal for CodeFellows - woohoo!

## About Me

Hi! My name is Jenna (she/her/hers), and I'm from Oregon. I have been an elementary teacher for the last five years and am switching to reading specialist next year. I did coding for my robotics team in high school for FTC Robotics, and took one term of Computer Science classes at OSU. After an awful experience at school and a great expereince volunteering for a LEGO robotics program at an elementary school, I switched paths to be a teacher! I love learning all things technology, extending my learning, and practicing different skills. When I'm off the computer, I love to read, doing photography, going on walks/hikes with my dog and my husband, and playing video games. 

# Growth Mindset

_Having a positive outlook on tasks or things that you are not confident about, and knowing that you can continue to learn and grow to get to where you want to be._

## Growth Mindset Reminders

1. I can become better the more I practice and learn.

2. I am not there yet.

3. I can ask others for advice who have been doing something longer than me.
