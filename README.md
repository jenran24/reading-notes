# Reading Notes

My reading journal for CodeFellows - woohoo!

## About Me

Hi! My name is Jenna (she/her/hers), and I'm from Oregon. I have been an elementary teacher for the last five years and am switching to reading specialist next year. I did coding for my robotics team in high school for FTC Robotics, and took one term of Computer Science classes at OSU. After an awful experience at school and a great expereince volunteering for a LEGO robotics program at an elementary school, I switched paths to be a teacher! I love learning all things technology, extending my learning, and practicing different skills. When I'm off the computer, I love to read, doing photography, going on walks/hikes with my dog and my husband, and playing video games. 

# Growth Mindset

_Having a positive outlook on tasks or things that you are not confident about, and knowing that you can continue to learn and grow to get to where you want to be._

## Growth Mindset Reminders

1. I can become better the more I practice and learn.

2. I am not there yet.

3. I can ask others for advice who have been doing something longer than me.

# Markdown

## What is it?

Markdown is the syntax to use when coding in GitHub. It allows for the designer to create different text effects, structures, and formats when creating a webpage. We use Markdown to help make webpages more engaging and to create easy to read, formatted web pages.

## What are some examples?

You can do common text editing using Markdown using symbols found on your keboard.

1. To create headings, simply add # before the word/phrase you want to use. The largest heading only needs one pound sign, while smaller headings are made with multiple pound symbols (the smallest one would have 3).

2. To **bold** or *italicize* words, using the asterick symbol * on both sides of the text you're using will emphasize your text. You can also use underscores, however Markdown can get conused with underscores if it's in the middle of a word.

3. Creating links (or adding links) requires parenthesis! You can be as simple as posting the link directly in the page by putting the full link in parenthesis, or by hyperlinking it to text by bracketing [ ] the text, then immediately following with the parenthesized link.

4. Creating unnumbered lists requires to have one or more lines of text that start with one of these three symbols: -, *, or +. Any of these symbols will create a bulletted list as long as they are each on their own line.
