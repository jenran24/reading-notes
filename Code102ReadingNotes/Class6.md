# Dynamic Web Pages with JavaScript

## How Computers Work

Copmuters are stuffed with amazing different components that allow it to take information, store information, process information, and give information back to you. Early computers were large, slow, and ginormous. Modern computers us circuits and electricity to process information and give outputs. The binary systems is based on place values that multiply by 2's, and the more wires you have in a circuit, the more information the computer can handle. You can use different programs to create various codes and practice coding skills.

## JavaScript

JavaScript is a program that allows you to code your site to have dynamic content, or parts of a website that changes based on the user of the site. JavaScript variables are values that the user of the site gives that can change depending on the users input, such as clicking on a link or their information given on an input form. We declare variables to store in the code what that variable means for when it is referenced.

An assignment operater is shown the the "=" sign. This operator tells JavaScript to find the value of something, such as x + 5 = x tells JavaScript to find the value of x + 5 and output it into x. When JavaScript receives input from a user, or an interaction from the user on the site, it processes the input and gives an output depending on their interaction.
