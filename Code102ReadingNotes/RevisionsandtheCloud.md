# Notes on This Exercise

Quite honestly, I learned a lot and it was a struggle. I understand the process for the most part, but I'm frustrated that I was just getting a grasp on GitHub and feeling confident there, then got thrown into a new program that takes many steps to do what I could have done on GitHub. I understand why there is a different process using Ubundu and VSCode, but I wish there was more practice with GitHub before being dropped into a new program.
