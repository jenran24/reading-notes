# Programming with JavaScript

## Control Flow

Control flow in JavaScript telsl the computer what statements in a script, or text, to follow in order. A computer normally reads a code from the first line through the last line. But, when loops or conditionals are involved, that won't work well. With those statements in, it tells the computer what functions to do in a specific order.

## JavaScript Function

A Javascript function perfoms a specific task when "something" happens. This "something" is an input that you can tell JavaScript to keep an eye out for. When you "invoke" a function, you are calling for that function to happen. It tells the computer to either to follow the code when the event occurs, when the code specifically calls for it, or when it is automatically called. We can give the functions parameters to be called in within (). This tells the code to follow the function if specific parameters, or rules, are met.
