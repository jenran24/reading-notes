# Operators and Loops

## Expressions

In JavaScript, we can use expressions to find answers. Expressions are a valid unit of code that turns into a value. Some expressions will have an effect, such as assigning values, and some expressions solely evaluate. We can create expressions that gives the answer to a given problem (expression), give us a true or false value, or gives us basic expressions.

## Loops

While expressions give us values and answers/outputs, loops are given information and are told to do something based on that information...and it does it repeatedly. I could tell a robot to take five steps to the right and the robot would move five steps to the right. We use loops in our code to repeat an action as long as it's true, or relevant, until it is no longer happening. Then it would do something else.

There are various different types of loops. One that is frequently used are "for" loops. These loops repeat a code or action until it is determined to be false. An example:

for (initialization; condition; afterthought)
    statement

The "intialization" tells me that something has been executed or ran. "Condition" tells the code to make sure that what is happening is true, and "afterthought" is executed as long as the statement executes.

"While" loops run while (hehehe...see what I did there?) a certain condition is true. If it becomes false, then the loop ends and it moves to the next statement in the code.
