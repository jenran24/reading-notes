# The Coder's Computer

When coding, it's important to know what features are available to you and what applications there are to use! Read below to find some tips and tricks.

## Four Features to Look for in a Text Editor

A text editor allows you to write and manage text to potentially create a website. Below are four tips to think of while looking at text editor software:

1. Code Completion
2. Syntax Highlighting
3. Variety of Themes
4. Ability to choose from many different extensions

## Important Commands to Know

Some commands you may commonly see and what they do:

1. **pwd** - Stands for Print Working Directory. Typing this in will tell you what directory, or file, you're working under in your computer.
2. **ls** - This command tells us what is in the directory we're currently in.
3. **cd** - This command allows you to change directory and move to somwhere else.
4. **mkdir** - Standing for "make directory," this allows you to - you guessed it - make a new directory.
5. **touch** - Allows you to create a file that doesn't have any content and to change the file's timestamp.

## Example

Let's take a look at the lines of code below:

1. cd projects
2. mkdir new-project
3. touch new-project/newfile.md
4. cd ..
5. ls projects/new-project

What are we doing with that list?
1. *cd projects* > We're moving to the Projects directory
2. *mkdir new-project* > I'm making a new directory or file in the Projects directory
3. *touch new-project/newfile.md* > I'm making a file in the new directory I made in step 2
4. *cd ..* > I'm going back to the Project directory
5. *ls projects/new-project* > Will show me what file, or files, are in the new directory I made in step 2
