# Markdown

## What is it?

Markdown is the syntax to use when coding in GitHub. It allows for the designer to create different text effects, structures, and formats when creating a webpage. We use Markdown to help make webpages more engaging and to create easy to read, formatted web pages.

## What are some examples?

You can do common text editing using Markdown using symbols found on your keboard.

1. To create headings, simply add # before the word/phrase you want to use. The largest heading only needs one pound sign, while smaller headings are made with multiple pound symbols (the smallest one would have 3).

2. To **bold** or *italicize* words, using the asterick symbol * on both sides of the text you're using will emphasize your text. You can also use underscores, however Markdown can get conused with underscores if it's in the middle of a word.

3. Creating links (or adding links) requires parenthesis! You can be as simple as posting the link directly in the page by putting the full link in parenthesis, or by hyperlinking it to text by bracketing [ ] the text, then immediately following with the parenthesized link.

4. Creating unnumbered lists requires to have one or more lines of text that start with one of these three symbols: -, *, or +. Any of these symbols will create a bulletted list as long as they are each on their own line.
